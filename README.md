## 🧩 How It Works
- **🔐 Password Hashing**: We use SHA-256 to hash your passwords. This way, your sensitive data is never stored in plaintext, reducing the risk of exposure.
- **📦 File Storage**:Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted before being stored in 'passwords.json'.

- - -
## 🎨 Usage
   Once you launch the application, you'll be greeted with a stylish menu:
- **1. ✨ Add a New Password**:Enter the website name and your password. We’ll securely hash it and save it for future use.
- **2. 🔍 Retrieve a Password**:Input the website name to check if a password is stored. Note: For your security, passwords are not displayed in plaintext.
- **3. 🚪 Exit**:Close the application when you’re done.
